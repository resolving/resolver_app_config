# Resolver App Config

Adds the basics of a Resolver consumer application:

* Default HTTP headers for all HTTP responses

## Installation

```ruby
gem 'resolver_app_config'
```

And then execute:

## HTTP headers module

This module adds some default HTTP headers to all HTTP responses.
Currently, all headers are security related but the module is not
limited to these headers only.
